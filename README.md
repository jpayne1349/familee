## a family tree web app

I've always taken an interest in the history of my family
and visualizing it is difficult. I know there are many other versions of this,
but making my own seemed like a neat project. I would like it to be open-source and
free to use. Maybe you only use it once and then print out your tree? That's fine.


### structure currently:
* PostgreSQL Database (Flask-SQLAlchemy)
  * Flask App Factory
    * Vanilla Javascript, Regular CSS


This is my first project to use GitHub's Issues, so feel free to open an issue and ask a question, suggest improvements, etc.


P.S. I'm programming out of VSCode and Google Chrome and aware some of the code will not run in other browsers right now.
