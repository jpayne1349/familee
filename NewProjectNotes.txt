A few notes for the startup of a new project.

*** Notes are somewhat specific to MacOS.

1. create a new virtual env with: python3 -m venv env

2. getting into environment: source env/bin/activate

3. installing dependencies, some needed right away, some not: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - creating the file is done via: pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. create a .gitignore file if necessary.

5. link remote and local repos on gihub if necessary

6. from within virtual environment, type "flask run" and server should start


7+ include instructions for an sqlite database setup.

a sample config file would also help someone get started.
